        - Additional seeders are generated and executed to ensure the database is fully populated with the required default configurations.

3. **Admin Account Setup**

    - After the installation process, the command prompts you to provide **Admin Login Credentials** (email and password).
    - These credentials are used to log in to the admin panel.

4. **Installation Complete**  
   Once the above steps are finished, the installation process is complete, and you can start using Aureus ERP.

Thatâ€™s it! With just one command, your Aureus ERP environment is ready to use.

### Installing a Plugin

To install a plugin, use the following command syntax:

```

For example, to install the Inventories plugin:

```bash
php artisan inventories:install
```

During installation, the system will check for dependencies and prompt you if there are any conflicts or prerequisites:

  [2] Show Seeders
```

Options:

### Uninstalling a Plugin

To remove a plugin, use the following command syntax:

```bash
php artisan <plugin-name>:uninstall
```

For example, to uninstall the Inventories plugin:
